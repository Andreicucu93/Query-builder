I had the need to find a way to generate queries easier based on my input.

This app was designed to work best in retail, but can be easily customised.
The dropdown contains the attributes used to generate the queries

Example:
User input (ID): 1, 2, 3, 4 (excel column type, no separator)
Result: ID in ('1','2','3','4','5')

The user will click the "Copy to clipboard" to get thee query.
